##  Focus Areas
My goal is to transition from basic syntax to engineering-grade solutions, focusing on skills relevant to Linux System Administration and DevOps:

* **Python Scripting:** Writing clean, reusable scripts for automation.
* **Algorithmic Logic:** Solving Codewars challenges (7kyu - 6kyu) with a focus on code efficiency.
* **Data Handling:** Manipulating strings, lists, and dictionaries to process data.

##  Repository Structure
* `Kata_Solutions/`: My solutions to logic challenges, organized by difficulty.
* `Scripts/`: Practical Python scripts for file handling and automation tasks.
* `Concepts/`: Demonstrations of key Python concepts.
* `Daily_Log.md`: A concise journal of my learning progress.

##  History
This is the second phase of my learning journey.
* **Phase 1 (2025):** [Initial Study Notes](https://github.com/Timothy403/DWP-Makers-Prep-Archive-2025.git)
* **Phase 2 (Current):** Refining fundamentals, best practices, and gaining applicable experience.
